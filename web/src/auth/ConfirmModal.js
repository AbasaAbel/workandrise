Confidentiality and Security
        * workandrise has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal data, workandrise cannot ensure and does not warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
        We limit access to personal information about you to our employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
        Your personal information is never shared outside workandrise without your permission, except under conditions required by courts of law. Inside workandrise, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in Germany or any other country where workandrise, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.
        workandrise will share information with government agencies as required by law, including without limitation, in connection with reporting earnings. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), at the request of governmental authorities or other third parties conducting an investigation, to protect the property and rights of workandrise or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, fraudulent, unethical or legally actionable activity. We may also use Device Identifiers to identify workandrise Users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties at our discretion.
        You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these with others.
